# Object-oriented Programming Challenge: SVG Logo Maker
## Description
This application serves the purpose of facilitating the creation of a "logo.svg" file. Users can input a three-character text, choose text color, and select a shape from circle, triangle, or square, along with its color, to generate the logo.

## Installation
Ensure Node.js is installed to run this application.
Create a .gitignore file with node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ to prevent tracking these directories on GitHub.
Set up a package.json by running npm init before installing dependencies.
Install inquirer.js by running npm i inquirer@8.2.4 in the integrated terminal.
Install Jest for testing purposes.
Invoke the application using node index.js.

## Usage
Run the application and respond to the series of prompts to generate a logo.svg for your project.
The prompts are located in the index.js file of this repository.
Press Enter after each response to proceed to the subsequent prompt. Upon completing all prompts, a logo.svg file will be automatically generated.
View the generated logo.svg logo by copying/pasting the code in a live server/browser to see the results.

## Test
Run npm test for testing.
